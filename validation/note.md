The R code can be used for implementing the M5 benchmarks for the case of the point forecasts (Accuracy competition).

The code describes - among others - the way the weights are calculated per series, the scaling applied, as well as how the final scores are computed per level and in total.

Given that the validation test-set is not provided to the participants at this stage of the competition, a dummy test-set is given instead to enable the calculation of the scores.
