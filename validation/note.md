The R code can be used for implementing the M5 benchmarks for the case of the point forecasts (Accuracy competition).

The code described among other the way the weights are calculated per series, the scaling is applied, as well as the final score is computed per level and in total.

Given that the validation test-set is not provided to the participants at this stage of the competition, a dummy test-set is given instead to enable the calculation of the scores.
